ETSpy is a [HyperSpy](https://hyperspy.org) extension package package for the processing, aligment, and reconstruction
of electron tomography data from TEM/STEM instruments. Tools are provided for basic 
tilt series data processing, stack alignment, and reconstruction using the
[ASTRA Toolbox](https://astra-toolbox.com/).

## Installation

Depending on your system, there are a few ways to install ETSpy. Due to 
dependencies that require compilation of binaries and the use of GPU-accelerated
libraries, [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda) is the simplest way to
get started. It will auto-detect CUDA-capable GPUs and install the correct version
of whatever packages are required.

### Anaconda (Preferred)

  *Works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux*

  * First, ensure you have either [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)
    or [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) installed on your system.

  * Run the following command to create a new environment based on the contents
    of the ETSpy YAML specification file, which will install the required dependencies,
    and then activate the newly created environment:
    
    ```shell
    $ conda env create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usnistgov/etspy/refs/heads/master/resources/etspy.yml
    # if you would like your environment to be stored in a specific place, use the "-p <path>" option
    
    $ conda activate etspy
    ```

  * Finally, (with the `etspy` environment activated), install the ETSpy package
    from PyPI:

    ```shell
    (etspy) $ pip install etspy
    ``` 

####  Optional Jupyter components (higly recommended)

  * To use ETSpy from within a Jupyter Lab/Notebook environment, a few other optional 
    dependencies are required.
    * `ipympl` enables interactive plotting in Jupyter Lab or Notebook.  
    * `ipykernel` allows use of the the etspy kernel with Jupyter installed in a different environment. 

    ```shell
    (etspy) $ conda install ipympl ipykernel
    ```

  * To "register" the python kernel associated with the `etspy` conda environment, run
    the following after ensuring that environment is activated (with `conda activate etspy`):

    ```shell
    (etspy) $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name ETSpy
    ```

    You will then be able to select the "ETSpy" kernel when running Jupyter and creating new
    notebooks

###  Using pip

  *Works on Linux, with additional prerequisites*

  Assuming you have the prequisite packages on your system (including
  the [CUDA libraries](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html)),
  ETSpy should be able to be installed with a simple `pip` command (it is recommended to install
  ETSpy in a dedicated virtual environment):

  ```{tip}
  On Ubuntu-based systems, the NVIDIA/CUDA dependencies installed via the system-provided `nvidia-cuda-toolkit` apt package may be out of date and incompatible with the ASTRA toolkit. We recommend installing the version directly from NVIDIA.
  ```

  * ```shell
    $ pip install etspy
    ```

  * To use ETSpy in Jupyter interface from within a dedicated virtual environment, installing
    `ipykernel` and `ipympl` are necessary (as with Anaconda). This can be done by specifying
    the `[jupyter]` group when installing ETSpy:

    ```shell
    $ pip install etspy[jupyter]
    ```

  * To register the ETSpy virtual environment as a Jupyter kernel, run the following with
    the virtual environment enabled:

    ```shell
    (etspy) $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name ETSpy
    ```

  Some dependencies of ETSpy require compilation of C code, meaning using the Anaconda approach
  above will simplify things greatly if you have trouble with "pure" `pip`.

### Removal

The package can be removed with:

```shell
$ pip uninstall etspy
```

### Developer instructions

If you wish to contribute to ETSpy or otherwise install a development version,
this can be accomplished using either [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)
or [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org).

If using conda, create and activate a new environment using the *development* specification,
clone the repository, and then install the package in "editable" mode using `pip`:

```shell
$ conda env create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usnistgov/etspy/refs/heads/master/resources/etspy-dev.yml
$ conda activate etspy-dev
$ git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/etspy
$ cd etspy
$ pip install -e .
```

If using Poetry (currently only working on Linux), make sure you have `poetry` and the
CUDA libraries installed, clone the `etspy` repository, and run the install command:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/etspy
$ cd etspy
$ poetry install
```

```{note}
Sometimes, on headless Linux systems without a desktop environment installed, the `poetry install`
command will hang due to an outstanding issue with handling the system keyring
(see [this issue](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/8623)). To workaround the issue,
run the command `export PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.null.Keyring` prior to running
`poetry install`, and it should work. 
```

At this point, you should have an "editable" version of the latest development
version of ETSpy installed to hack on as you wish.

Contributions to the project are welcome, and can be submitted via the GitHub pull
request mechanism.

## Basic Usage

The majority of the functionality of ETSpy can be accessed by importing the `etspy.api` module.
For example, to load a tilt series dataset into a `TomoStack`, you could do the following:

```python
import etspy.api as etspy
stack = etspy.load('TiltSeries.mrc')
```

For more details, see the dedicated [documentation](https://pages.nist.gov/etspy), including
the [example Jupyter notebook](https://pages.nist.gov/etspy/examples) and the more detailed
[API Reference](https://pages.nist.gov/etspy/api).

## Development tips (testing and coverage)

ETSpy strives to have high code coverage through the use of tests in the `etspy/tests/` directory.
When developing, you can run the tests from the main directory with the following command, which
will output the coverage results to the terminal, as well as to a `etspy/tests/coverage.xml` file that can
be interpreted by various editors to display the coverage stats interactively, and as html in the
`etspy/tests/htmlcov` directory that can be viewed in a web browser:

```shell
$ poetry run pytest etspy/tests/
```

By default, this will exclude CUDA-related code from the coverage
report (via the `[tool.coverage.report]` setting in `pyproject.toml`),
since most CI/CD systems will not have CUDA enabled. If you would
like to run the tests with coverage (including CUDA), you can use
the `run_tests.sh` helper script (on Linux), which will detect whether
or not CUDA is available, and choose whether or not to exclude those
lines from the report depending:

```shell
$ poetry run ./run_tests.sh
```

<!-- ### Matplotlib figure tests

ETSpy uses the [`pytest-mpl`](https://pytest-mpl.readthedocs.io/) pytest
plugin to compare the outputs of certain tests to a "baseline" reference
to see if the output of the figure has changed since what was expected.
This is configured under the `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` of the
`pyproject.toml` file, so these tests should run automatically when
using the above commands, but you will have to run a separate command
the first time you write a test that checks a figure's output
(or if a method has changed such that a new baseline image is required).
First, follow the plugin's
[docs](https://pytest-mpl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html) for
writing tests (use the `mpl_image_compare` marker and make sure the
test returns a Matplotlib `Figure`; it's also recommended to use the
`remove_text=True` option to prevent issues between different versions
of the freetype library). Then, the first time you run
the test, you will need to generate the baseline images that will
be used to compare against on subsequent runs. To do so, run `pytest`
with the `--mpl-generate-path=etspy/tests/test_data/pytest_mpl_figures`
option (the `-m "mpl_image_compare"` flag limits pytest to only
run the tests that involve figures, and the `--no-cov` flag
disables coverage for this run, since it's not relevant):

```shell
$ poetry run pytest -m "mpl_image_compare" --mpl-generate-path=etspy/tests/test_data/pytest_mpl_figures --no-cov
```

This will run through the test suite, saving any figures that are
required for the `pytest-mpl` tests. Make sure to commit these images
to the repository, as they become part of the test suite and will
be referenced the next time you use `./run_tests.sh`. -->

### Debugging when using coverage

ETSpy has the test suite configured to automatically run code coverage
analysis when using `pytest`. This interferes when using interactive
debuggers (such as PyCharm or VSCode), since they use the same mechanism
under the hood to inspect what code is being run. This will manifest as
your breakpoints never triggering when running a "Debug" configuration.
For more information, see the following links:
[one](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/693),
[two](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67185092),
[three](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-20186). There are a
few workarounds discussed in those threads, but the gist is that
when debugging, you should disable the coverage plugin to ensure
that breakpoints will be hit. This varies depending on your IDE/setup,
but one option for VSCode is to put the following configuration
in your project's `launch.json`, which will ensure coverage is disabled
when running "Debug test" via the `PYTEST_ADDOPTS` environment variable:

```json
  {
      "name": "Debug Tests",
      "type": "debugpy",
      "request": "launch",
      "purpose": ["debug-test"],
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "justMyCode": false,
      "env": {"PYTEST_ADDOPTS": "--no-cov"}
  }
```
