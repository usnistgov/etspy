# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  setup:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: aaherzing/tomotools:latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

  build:
    # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
    needs: setup
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      -run: pip install .

  testing:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
